However, GSAP has its own licensing requirements that you must comply with when using this package:

* GSAP is free for most use cases, including personal projects and non-commercial applications.
* If you use GSAP in a commercial product where customers pay to access the animations, you *may* need a GreenSock Club membership with a paid license.
